        <h2>Testimonial 11</h2>
        <p>To date, I consider myself a blessing that I came upon paint n brush while taking a walk. The day I met her was amazing. And she's an amazing artist. For someone with no experience with any sort of drawing or art she made me an artist.Her Classes were a discovery and adventure, but more than anything, Meena has helped me believe in my talent. Help me appreciate the never ending, ever changing beauty of art. Today's exhibition is just a proof of what a talented artist can do. The children works are amazing, full of character and inspiring. I seek new techniques and adventure just because of her.<br>Bindhu Joseph</p>
